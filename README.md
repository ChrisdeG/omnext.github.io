# Omnext

* This Github repository is to open source the best practices used by Omnext to check your Mendix model. You can fork this repository, make changes, add new rules and then create a pull request. You can also add issues.


## Run the site locally

To set up your environment to develop this theme follow the installation instructions on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
and run in the directory you cloned to `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme and the contents of the `_best_practice/` directory. As you make modifications to the site, the site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
